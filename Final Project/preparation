For my final project, I plan on creating a musical instrument. I plan to use 5 stepper motors to generate the sound each of which
have different speeds/sounds. I will create a wooden box to hold these motors. The speed and sound of these motors will be 
dictated by how close objects are to a proximity sensor in front of the box. The sketch for the project can be seen in this same folder

Top 3 Questions:
How can I use the stepper motors to create different sounds? 
How can I properly use wood to create good acoustics?
What type of sensor might I use to be accurate? Is it possible to "hide" this sensor behind wood and still detect only 
  motion changes on the outside of the box?
  
  Required Materials: 
  - 5 Stepper Motors
  - Thin Wood
  - 5 distance/proximity sensors
